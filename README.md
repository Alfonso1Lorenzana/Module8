# Module8

This Challenge prompts the user to either create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. After going through the creation or selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions with the selected vehicle. The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application.

Because this application won't be deployed, you'll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. You'll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
